We’re a global early-stage VC backing founders from day zero. We invest up to €400k through our founder residency – a building sprint where you leverage community, sparring, and intense effort to make 1 year of progress in 10 weeks.\n\n\n\n\nWe have now opened applications for our next Nordics residency starting September 1st, 2025. Build your company alongside a cohort of pre-vetted, exceptional potential co-founders, validate your ideas, engage with customers, develop your MVP, refine your business model, and create your go-to-market strategy before pitching to the investment committee.\n\n\n\n\nAbout You:\n\nWe are looking for Founders, CEOs, CTOs, and others eager to build the next disruptive tech venture from the ground up.\n\nFounder DNA: The residency is built for fully-committed, full-time entrepreneurs (or will go full time by the point of the residency). You know what it means to be a founder and are ready to take it on for the right reasons. Grit, integrity, determination, commitment, humility, and resilience describe you.\nExperience: Successful Antler Founders have a honed skill in addition to Founder DNA. Examples include sales, software development, product design, domain expertise, fundraising, etc. Many worked at startups as founders or employees in the past.\nIndustry Focus: Antler is industry agnostic, as seen in our portfolio of investments. Antler has invested in over 1,500+ companies to date across many industries. In the Nordics, we have an active portfolio size of >150 companies that is well-balanced across different sectors.\n\n\n\n\nThe Antler Founder Residency:\n\nThe residency starts on September 1st, 2025, and runs for 10 weeks, full-time, in-person in Copenhagen. Any adjustments have to be agreed to in the interview process.\n\nOur residency program is fairly unstructured, with 90%+ of the time focused dedicated to founders working on their companies and making week-over-week progress. Here are some examples of things that founders focus on, depending on where they are at in their company journey:\n\n\n\n\nFind and vet potential cofounders\nValidate core assumptions around your business ideas and find meaningful market insight\nBuild prototypes, find design partners, launch pilots, close customers\nGet feedback from functional experts and dedicated coaches\nReach milestones that align with pre-seed funding\n\n\n\n\nIf founders have already accomplished any of the above, they dedicate their full effort on the next most important milestones.\n\n\n\n\nAntler Investment Process\n\nAt the end of the 10-week residency, you will have the opportunity to present to the Antler Investment Committee. If approved by the investment committee, you will receive a pre-seed commitment of €400,000 in two tranches. €100k for 10% and €300k in follow-on capital.\nCompanies that receive investment at the end of the residency will join the Antler portfolio and gain even higher touch programming from our partners. This includes access our network of downstream investors, integration into the Antler Nordics portfolio and global portfolio network, and introductions to relevant partners and discounted service providers.\n\n\n\n\nAbout Antler\n\nAntler is a early-stage VC that is changing the way people build companies. We operate in 30 locations worldwide, have supported 8,000+ founders through our residencies, and invested in 1500+ startups globally. We launched Antler to build a better on-ramp to venture capital. After working in venture-backed companies for years, we built Antler to provide founders with a structured and transparent process to successfully launch a new venture, a community for support throughout the experience, and a clear pathway to venture funding.\n\n\n\n\nAntler Highlights:\n\nSome examples of successful companies that were built as a result of Antler’s residency, received pre-seed investment from Antler, and have gone on to raise substantial investments are as follows:\n\nAiralo: The world’s first eSIM subscription and top-up store\nWingbits: Incentive-based flight tracking platform\nTreyd: Working capital operating system for B2B\nReebelo: Used electronics marketplace\nTelgea: Global telecom operator\nGlint Solar: Software for identifying the best solar sites faster\n\n\n\n\nCohort starts: September 1st, 2025\n\n\n\n\nAPPLY NOW','https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4257945758/','2025-06-30',NULL,NULL,'[\"Start-ups\", \"Erhverv\", \"Finans\", \"Grit\", \"Iværksætteri\", \"Marketing\", \"Resiliency\", \"Salgsvækst\"]',NULL,'2025-06-30 14:01:37','2025-06-30 14:01:37'),(50,4257918020,'Game Presenter – Relocate to Malta (Fluent Danish Required) - Evolution',34,'København, Region Hovedstaden, Danmark','Om jobbet\n\nJoin Evolution in sunny Malta as a Game Presenter!

Build your company alongside a cohort of pre-vetted, exceptional potential co-founders, validate your ideas, engage with customers, develop your MVP, refine your business model, and create your go-to-market strategy before pitching to the investment committee.\n\n\n\n\nAbout You:\n\nWe are looking for Founders, CEOs, CTOs, and others eager to build the next disruptive tech venture from the ground up.\n\nFounder DNA: The residency is built for fully-committed, full-time entrepreneurs (or will go full time by the point of the residency). You know what it means to be a founder and are ready to take it on for the right reasons. Grit, integrity, determination, commitment, humility, and resilience describe you.\nExperience: Successful Antler Founders have a honed skill in addition to Founder DNA. Examples include sales, software development, product design, domain expertise, fundraising, etc. Many worked at startups as founders or employees in the past.\nIndustry Focus: Antler is industry agnostic, as seen in our portfolio of investments.

Here are some examples of things that founders focus on, depending on where they are at in their company journey:\n\n\n\n\nFind and vet potential cofounders\nValidate core assumptions around your business ideas and find meaningful market insight\nBuild prototypes, find design partners, launch pilots, close customers\nGet feedback from functional experts and dedicated coaches\nReach milestones that align with pre-seed funding\n\n\n\n\nIf founders have already accomplished any of the above, they dedicate their full effort on the next most important milestones.\n\n\n\n\nAntler Investment Process\n\nAt the end of the 10-week residency, you will have the opportunity to present to the Antler Investment Committee. If approved by the investment committee, you will receive a pre-seed commitment of €400,000 in two tranches. €100k for 10% and €300k in follow-on capital.\nCompanies that receive investment at the end of the residency will join the Antler portfolio and gain even higher touch programming from our partners.

A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.\n\nTo achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.\n\nFor a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.\n\nA few examples of your responsibilities\nMaster your toolkit. By working across diverse tech stacks, you’ll refine your ability to choose the right tools for every challenge. From monolithic to microservices architectures, gRPC to REST APIs, Kubernetes to Docker, Python to Rust—you’ll show that true expertise isn’t about using the trendiest technologies, but about understanding their purpose to unleash their full potential.\nBuild stuff that matters. Regardless of your seniority, you’ll enjoy plenty of autonomy and take full ownership of your work, from ideation to execution. You’ll have the unique opportunity to build software from the ground up and witness firsthand how your code evolves into a product used at scale.\nSimplify relentlessly. Is every component essential? Do we need this process? As a Bending Spoons engineer, your mission is to turn complexity into simplicity. Whether optimizing CI/CD pipelines, writing maintainable code, or crafting minimalist architectures, your drive to simplify will power scalable, future-proof solutions.\n\n\nWhat we look for\nReasoning ability. Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.\nDrive. You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.\nTeam spirit. You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You\'re always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.\nProficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.\n\n\nWhat we offer\nIncredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams. You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.\nAn exceptional opportunity for growth. We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.\nCompetitive pay and access to equity in the company. Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career a salary of £66,779 in the UK and €63,965 elsewhere. If they possess a few years of relevant experience, the salary on offer tends to be between £110,389 and £149,636 in the UK, and €105,737 and €143,330 elsewhere. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.\nAll. These. Benefits. Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.\n\n\nCommitment & contract\nPermanent or fixed-term. Full-time.\n\nLocation\nMilan (Italy), London (UK) or remote.\n\nBefore you apply\nBending Spoons is a demanding environment: We\'re extremely ambitious and we ask a lot of ourselves and one another. While this tends to lead to fantastic learning, achievements, and career growth, it also requires a significant commitment. So if you like the role and are ready to give your very best, don\'t hesitate to apply.\n\nThe selection process\nIf you pass our screening, we’ll ask you to take on a few tests that assess how you approach unfamiliar problems. If you’re successful with those, we’ll invite you to a series of interviews.\n\nBending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment any applicant and we provide reasonable accommodations for an applicant with disabilities, which can be requested through this form.\n\nStudies suggest that women tend not to apply for a job if their CV isn’t a perfect fit. Here, talent takes precedence over experience. So if you like the role and think you could be awesome at it in time, go ahead and apply.\n\n\n\nØnskede kompetencer og erfaring\n\nAlgorithms, Attention to Detail, Code Refactoring, Computer Science, Debugging, Optimization, Problem Solving, Reasoning Skills, Software Development, Software Engineers','https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4257907578/','2025-06-30',8,NULL,'[\"Java\", \"JavaScript\", \"Kubernetes\", \"OOP\", \"Programmering\", \"REST APIs\", \"Softwareudvikling\", \"Webtjenester Amazon (AWS)\", \"REST\", \"Ræsonnement-færdigheder\"]',NULL,'2025-06-30 14:03:02','2025-06-30 14:03:02'),(62,4257988527,'Barnmorskor till BB Hemma i Lund',39,'Lund, Skåne len, Sverige','Om jobbet\n\nGör skillnad.

A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.\n\nTo achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.\n\nFor a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.\n\nA few examples of your responsibilities\nMaster your toolkit. By working across diverse tech stacks, you’ll refine your ability to choose the right tools for every challenge. From monolithic to microservices architectures, gRPC to REST APIs, Kubernetes to Docker, Python to Rust—you’ll show that true expertise isn’t about using the trendiest technologies, but about understanding their purpose to unleash their full potential.\nBuild stuff that matters. Regardless of your seniority, you’ll enjoy plenty of autonomy and take full ownership of your work, from ideation to execution. You’ll have the unique opportunity to build software from the ground up and witness firsthand how your code evolves into a product used at scale.\nSimplify relentlessly. Is every component essential? Do we need this process? As a Bending Spoons engineer, your mission is to turn complexity into simplicity. Whether optimizing CI/CD pipelines, writing maintainable code, or crafting minimalist architectures, your drive to simplify will power scalable, future-proof solutions.\n\n\nWhat we look for\nReasoning ability. Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.\nDrive. You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.\nTeam spirit. You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You\'re always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.\nProficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.\n\n\nWhat we offer\nIncredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams. You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.\nAn exceptional opportunity for growth. We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.\nCompetitive pay and access to equity in the company. Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career a salary of £66,779 in the UK and €63,965 elsewhere. If they possess a few years of relevant experience, the salary on offer tends to be between £110,389 and £149,636 in the UK, and €105,737 and €143,330 elsewhere. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.\nAll.

He couldn’t believe the amount of work being done on paper - and how distant he felt from his first child during the day. The paper ‘parent’ books they exchanged once a month just weren’t cutting it. Together with his friend, our co-founder and CEO Anders, they set about solving that.\n\nThese days, the 180 of us building Famly talk about trying to do one thing. Giving children the best possible start to life. Or rather, making it easier for the 8,000 nurseries and childcare centers who use Famly every day to that, on our behalf.\n\nWe do it with the world’s first Early Childhood Platform, software that brings hundreds of thousands of parents closer to their child’s day while they’re away from them.

We bridge the gap between large Earth observation models and specific application developers, enabling intuitive interaction with geospatial data. Our core mission is to empower decision-makers with rapid insights from vast, complex datasets. As part of our small, dynamic team, you will play a foundational role in building tools that have never existed before.\n\nRole Summary\n\nWe\'re looking for a creative and energetic Full Stack Software Engineer to join our founding product team. In this role, you\'ll take early-stage ideas and rapidly turn them into functional, interactive demos that showcase the potential of our platform. You\'ll work primarily in React and Python, interfacing with LGND\'s APIs, geospatial services, and large-scale AI frameworks — including emerging protocols like Model Context Protocol (MCP).\n\nThis is a fast-moving, experimental role designed to help us quickly validate features and use cases. You\'ll work closely with product and research leads, build lightweight interfaces to our backend infrastructure, and prototype interactions that bring geospatial data and AI results to life — especially through mapping and spatial UI.\n\nThis role is ideal for someone who thrives in ambiguity, ships quickly, and has a strong eye for product potential. It\'s a unique opportunity to help define and shape the frontend of an AI-native geospatial platform before we scale a broader engineering and design team.\n\nThis is a hybrid role, with a preference for candidates based in New York, San Francisco Bay Area, or Copenhagen. Remote work is also a possibility.\n\nKey Responsibilities\n\n\nRapid Prototyping: Take ideas from whiteboard to working demo in days — not weeks. Build and iterate on new products and features using lightweight frontends and LGND\'s backend APIs\nFrontend Development: Build rich, spatially aware interfaces using React, including map-based UIs (e.g., Mapbox), data visualizations, and lightweight dashboards\nAPI Integration: Work almost entirely against APIs, integrating LGND\'s services and MCP servers, as well as third-party geospatial services\nBackend Collaboration: Write or modify small backend components using Python, especially for internal tooling or lightweight extensions to our existing APIs\nInfrastructure-Aware UI: Build frontends that are responsive to real-world compute and data infrastructure constraints — particularly when working with large spatial datasets or ML workflows\nUX Experimentation: Help evaluate UX for interacting with embeddings, vector search results, and spatial metadata.

Vi arbejder dedikeret med agile arbejdsmetoder, DevOps og Test Driven Development, og er på forkant med mange af de nye teknologier, herunder IoT.

# Improved Job Rating System - Version 3 & Optimized

## Overview
The job rating system has evolved through multiple versions, culminating in the **optimized version** with fully configurable candidate profiles and scoring weights.

## System Versions

### Version 3 (match-jobs-v3)
- Works without descriptions - analyzes all available data
- English candidate profile for better AI understanding
- Optimized for incomplete data (can process all 1200+ jobs)

### Optimized Version (match-jobs-optimized) ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED**
- **Fully configurable candidate profile and preferences**
- **Customizable scoring weights**
- **JSON-based configuration system**
- **Reduced cognitive complexity and improved code quality**
- **Consistent constants and better error handling**

## Key Features of Optimized Version

    }
  }
}
```

### 2. **Customizable Scoring Weights**
```json
{
  "weights": {
    "location": 25,      // Distance and commute factors
    "tech_match": 35,    // Primary/secondary skills match  
    "company_fit": 20,   // Company size and culture
    "seniority_fit": 15, // Role level appropriateness
    "work_type_fit": 5   // Remote/hybrid flexibility
  }
}
```

### 3. **Intelligent Data Analysis**
- Uses job title, company, location, skills, applicant count
- Works with missing descriptions (55% of database)
- Estimates company size from name and applicant metrics
- Analyzes job titles for technology and seniority hints

## Usage

### Optimized Version (Recommended)

#### 1. Create Custom Configuration
```bash
# Generate default config file
make match-jobs-optimized-config
# Creates: job_match_config.json

# Edit the file to customize your preferences
# Modify skills, location, role preferences, scoring weights
```

#### 2. Run with Custom Configuration
```bash
# Basic run with custom config
make match-jobs-optimized-custom

# With detailed reasoning
make match-jobs-optimized-verbose

# Process all jobs
make match-jobs-optimized-all

# Direct command with options
go run cmd/match-jobs-optimized/main.go --config job_match_config.json --limit 10 --min-score 60 --verbose
```

### Version 3 Commands
```bash
# Test with a few jobs
make match-jobs-v3

# Process all jobs with good scores
make match-jobs-v3-all  

# Show detailed reasoning
make match-jobs-v3-verbose
```

### Command Options
- `--config FILE`: Use custom JSON configuration (optimized version only)
- `--save-config`: Create default configuration file
- `--limit N`: Process N jobs (0 = all jobs)
- `--min-score N`: Only show results above score N
- `--verbose`: Show detailed AI reasoning
- `--dry-run`: Show what would be processed

## Example Configuration Customization

### For a Remote-Only Python Developer
